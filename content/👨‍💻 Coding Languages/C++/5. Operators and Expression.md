# Expressions
## Expressions Vs Statements 

```cpp
// Statements 
int total_marks = pyhsics + chem + math; // statements 
x = y = z;

// Expressions
int x = 10; // 10 is a expression 
int y = 20, z = 30;
x = y = z + 10;
```
- Any [[4. Variables and Datatypes#Variables|variable]] name (x, y, z, ...), constant, or literal is an expression.
- One or more expressions combined by an operator constitute an expression, e.g., x + y or x * y  + z

In [[3. Getting started with C++|C++]], assignment is also an expression, e.g., x = y + z. As a consequence, it can be used within another assignment: x2 = x = y + z.
**Assignments are evaluated from right to left.**
# Statements

Any of the expressions above followed by a semicolon is a statement.

The variable and constant declarations we have seen before are also statements. As the initial value of a variable or constant, we can use any expression.

A single semicolon is an empty statement, and we can thus put as many semicolons after an expression as we want.
```cpp
int marks = 10 // statement 

5 + 3 // expression 
5 + 3; // statement 

int z = 5 + 3; // statement 
int total = marks; // statement 

// Control Statements 
if (...){

}
```
# Operators 

## [[4. Variables and Datatypes#Basic Arithmetic Operators|Arithmetic Operators]]

## Relational Operators 
A relational operator  is used to check the relationship between two operands.

| Operator | Function |
| ---- | ---- |
| == | isEqual to  |
| != | Not Equal to |
| > | Greater than |
| < | Lesser than |
| >= | Greater than or Equal to |
| <= | Lesser than or Equal to  |
## Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to check whether an expression is true or false. If the expression is true, it returns 1 whereas if the expression is false, it returns 0.

| Operator | Function |
| ---- | ---- |
| && | Logical AND |
| \|\| | Logical OR |
| ! | Logical NOT |
## Bitwise Operators 
In C++, bitwise operators are used to perform operations on individual bits. They can only be used alongside `char` and `int` data types.

| Operator | Function |
| ---- | ---- |
| & | Binary AND |
| \| | Binary OR |
| ^ | Binary XOR (Exclusive OR) |
| ~ | Binary one compliment (Flip all bits of a number) |
| << | Left Shift |
| >> | Right Shift |
## Assignment Operators 
Also known as **compound assignment operators** (combine binary operator with assignment operator).

| Operator | Function |
| ---- | ---- |
| = | Assignment  |
| += | Compound Addition |
| -= | Compound Subtraction |
| *= | Compound Multiplication |
| /= | Compound Division |
| %= | Compound Modulo  |
## Misc Operators 
Here's a list of some other common operators available in C++.

| Operator | Function |
| ---- | ---- |
| \[\[4. Variables and Datatypes#Size of Operator\|sizeof\]\] | returns size of datatype |
| \[\[6. Conditional Statements#Ternary Operator\|?:\]\] | Ternary operator |
| & | Address of operator |
| . | Dot operator |
| * | Dereference operator  |
| -> | Access members of objects |
### Increment Decrement
Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on variables and data.

| Operator | Function |
| ---- | ---- |
| ++ | Increment  |
| -- | Decrement  |
```cpp
int a = 10;

a++; // postincrement
++a; // preincrement

a--; // postdecrement
--a; // predecrement
```
