- Abstraction enables greater complexity and generality in hardware and software
- It involves hiding implementation details behind interfaces
- Moving tasks from hardware to software increases abstraction
	- Number representations
	- Character encoding schemes
	- Floating point math
	- Graphics rendering
	- Encryption/decryption
    - e.g. number representations moved from hardware circuits to software libraries
    - Abstracting these tasks in software increases flexibility and portability
- Higher levels of abstraction allow focusing more on the problem vs the hardware
