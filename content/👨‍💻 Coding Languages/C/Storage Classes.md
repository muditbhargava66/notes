- `extern`: variable/function defined externally
- `static` :
    - In global scope: limits visibility to file scope
    - In local scope: gives variable static storage duration
    - Use `static` sparingly in large programs:
	    - Creates tight coupling between modules
	    - Increases complexity to reason about state
