## Modeling Sequential Logic

- Edge-triggered flipflops using `always @(posedge clk)` 

- D Latch:
    ```verilog
    always @(D or Clk)
        if (Clk) 
            Q = D;
    ```

- D Flipflop: 
    ```verilog
     always @(posedge Clk)
        Q <= D; 
    ```

- Async Reset Flipflop:
    ```verilog
    always @(negedge Resetn or posedge Clock)
        if (!Resetn)
            Q <= 0;  
        else
            Q <= D;
    ```
