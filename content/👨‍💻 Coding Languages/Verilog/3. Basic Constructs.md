# Internal Signals
---
Verilog modules use **internal signals** to connect between sub-modules and build the overall functionality. These signals can be nets or variables assigned using continuous assignments (`assign`) or procedural assignments (`always` blocks).

# Precedence
---
Notice that we fully **parenthesized** the `cout` computation, We could take advantage of operator  precedence to use fewer parentheses:
```verilog
assign cout = a&b | cin&(a|b);
```
The precedence from highest to lowest is:

| Symbol | Meaning | Precedence |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| - | NOT  | Highest |
| *, /, % | MUL, DIV, MODULO  |  |
| +, - | PLUS, MINUS |  |
| <<, >>, | Logical Left/Logical Right |  |
| <<<, >>> | Arithmetic Left/Right Shift |  |
| <, <=, >, >= | Relative Comparsion |  |
| ==, != | Equality Comparision |  |
| &, ~& | AND, NAND |  |
| ^, ~^ | XOR, XNOR |  |
| \|, ~\| | OR, NOR |  |
| ?: | Conditional | Lowest |
> [!NOTE]
> The precedence order is as expected - AND before OR. 
> Follows conventional programming languages.

# Constants 
---
Verilog supports decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal constants:

| Number | No. of <br>Bits | Base | Decimal <br>Equivalent | Stored |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 3'b101 | 3 | Binary  | 5 | 101 |
| 'b11 | unsized  | Binary  | 3 | 00000000..00011 |
| 8'b11 | 8 | Binary  | 3 | 00000000..00011  |
| 8'b1010_1011 | 8 | Binary  | 171 | 10101011 |
| 3'd6 | 3 | Decimal  | 6 | 110 |
| 6'o42 | 6 | Octal  | 34 | 100010 |
| 8'hAB | 8 | Hexadecimal  | 171 | 10101011  |
| 42 | unsized  | Decimal  | 42 | 0000...00101010 |

> [!NOTE]
> It is good practice to specify the length of the number in bits, even though the second row shows that this is not strictly necessary. If you don't specify the length, one day you may be surprised when verilog assumes the constant has additional leading 0's that you didn't intend.

# Hierarchy
---
Verilog modules can be organized into a hierarchy of sub-modules. Each sub-module can have its own inputs, outputs, and internal signals. The hierarchy can be visualized as a tree, where each module is a node in the tree.

To create a hierarchy of sub-modules, you can use the `module` keyword to define a new module, and then instantiate it as a sub-module within another module.

The following example demonstrates the creation of a hierarchy of sub-modules:

```verilog
module my_top_module;

// Instantiate a sub-module
my_sub_module sub_module1 (
    .input1(in1),
    .input2(in2),
    .output1(out1),
    .output2(out2)
);

// Instantiate another sub-module
my_sub_module sub_module2 (
    .input1(out1),
    .input2(in3),
    .output1(out3),
    .output2(out4)
);

// Define inputs and outputs of top-level module
input in1, in2, in3;
output out1, out2, out3, out4;

endmodule

module my_sub_module (
    input wire input1,
    input wire input2,
    output wire output1,
    output wire output2
);

// Define internal signals and logic of sub-module
reg internal1, internal2;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    internal1 <= input1;
    internal2 <= input2;
end

assign output1 = internal1;
assign output2 = internal2;

endmodule
```

In this example, `my_top_module` has two sub-modules, `sub_module1` and `sub_module2`. Each sub-module has its own inputs and outputs, and can be instantiated multiple times within the top-level module.

# Tristate 
---
Verilog modules can have tristate outputs, which are outputs that can be in a high-impedance state (Z) in addition to the normal logic levels (0 and 1). Tristate outputs are useful for connecting multiple modules to a common bus.

To create a tristate output, you can use the `tristate` keyword in the output port declaration.

The following example demonstrates the creation of a tristate output:

```verilog
module my_module (
    input wire clk,
    input wire [7:0] din,
    output tristate [7:0] dout,
    output reg ready
);

// Define internal signals and logic of module
reg [7:0] internal_dout;

always @(posedge clk) begin
    internal_dout <= din;
    ready <= 1'b1;
end

assign dout = internal_dout;

endmodule
```

In this example, `dout` is a tristate output that can be in a high-impedance state (Z) or a normal logic level (0 or 1).

# Bit Swizzling
---
Verilog modules can have bit swizzling, which is the ability to rearrange the bits of a vector. Bit swizzling is useful for accessing individual bits of a vector in a different order than they are stored.

To create bit swizzling, you can use the `[]` operator to access individual bits of a vector.

The following example demonstrates the creation of bit swizzling:

```verilog
module my_module (
    input wire [7:0] din,
    output [3:0] dout0,
    output [3:0] dout1,
    output [3:0] dout2,
    output [3:0] dout3
);

// Define internal signals and logic of module
reg [7:0] internal_din;

assign dout0 = internal_din[3:0];
assign dout1 = internal_din[7:4];
assign dout2 = internal_din[6:4];
assign dout3 = internal_din[7:6];

always @(posedge clk) begin
    internal_din <= din;
end

endmodule
```

In this example, `din` is an 8-bit input vector, and `dout0`, `dout1`, `dout2`, and `dout3` are 4-bit output vectors. The bits of `din` are rearranged using bit swizzling to produce the output vectors.

# Delays in Verilog
---
In Verilog, delays can be specified for both inputs and outputs of modules. Delays can be defined using the `@` symbol followed by a time value. There are two types of delays in Verilog: transport delays and inertial delays.

## Transport Delays
---
Transport delays are associated with the input and output ports of a module. They represent the time it takes for a signal to propagate from the input to the output. Transport delays are specified using the `@` symbol followed by a time value after the input or output port.

The following example demonstrates the use of transport delays on both input and output ports:

```verilog
module my_module (
    input wire clk,
    input wire [7:0] din,
    output reg [7:0] dout,
    output reg ready
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    dout <= din;
    ready <= 1'b1;
end

// Transport delay on input port
always @(posedge clk) begin
    dout <= din @(posedge clk + 10ns);
    ready <= 1'b1;
end

// Transport delay on output port
always @(posedge clk) begin
    dout <= din;
    ready @(posedge clk + 20ns);
end

endmodule
```

## Inertial Delays
---
Inertial delays are associated with the internal signals of a module. They represent the time it takes for a signal to propagate through a logic gate. Inertial delays are specified using the `@` symbol followed by a time value after the signal.

The following example demonstrates the use of inertial delays on internal signals:

```verilog
module my_module (
    input wire clk,
    input wire [7:0] din,
    output reg [7:0] dout,
    output reg ready
);

always @(posedge clk) begin
    dout <= din;
    ready @(posedge clk + 10ns);
end

// Inertial delay on internal signal
always @(posedge clk) begin
    dout <= din @(posedge clk + 10ns);
    ready @(posedge clk + 20ns);
end

endmodule
```

It is important to note that transport delays are applied to the input and output ports of a module, while inertial delays are applied to the internal signals.
