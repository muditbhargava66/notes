# & Operator
---
`Address Of` Operator (&)

- To get the address of a variable, we can use the address-of operator (&)
- Address will be in Hexadecimal number, i.e. $(16)^{Base}$
- Hexadecimal number starts with 0x.........

```cpp
int p=5;   
cout << p << endl; // 5 
cout << &p << endl; // Address of p
```

- The & operator returns a pointer to its operand
- It can be applied to variables, arrays, functions, etc.
- Does not allocate new memory, simply returns existing address

| Input | Operator | Type | Explanation | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |  
| 5 & 3 | Bitwise AND | Binary | Performs a bitwise AND operation on the binary representations of 5 and 3 |
| &x | Address of | Unary | Returns a pointer to the variable x. This does not perform a bitwise operation. |
The key things to understand:

- The & operator behaves differently depending on the context
    - With two numeric operands (e.g. 5 & 3), it performs a bitwise AND operation
    - With a single variable operand (e.g. &x), it returns the memory address of that variable
- Bitwise AND operates on the binary representations of integers
    - Compares each bit position and sets to 1 only if both bits are 1
- Address of returns a pointer
    - This is a memory address that can be used to access the variable
    - Allows passing variables by reference instead of by value 

> [!NOTE]  Summary
> - & with two numbers → bitwise AND
> - & with a variable → address of operator

**Example**
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){

  int x = 10;

  cout << &x << endl; 
  // Prints memory address of x in hexadecimal format

  float y;

  cout << &y << endl;
  // Prints memory address of uninitialized float variable y

  char letter = 'A'; 

  cout << &letter << endl;  
  // Prints address of char variable letter

  cout << (void *)&letter << endl; 
  // Casts &letter to a void* pointer 
  // Allows printing as hexadecimal address instead of char

  int arr[100];

  cout << arr << endl; 
  // Prints base address of array arr
  // Array name represents address of first element

  cout << &arr << endl;
  // Prints address of entire array variable

  return 0;
}
```

Key points:
- & operator prints the memory address
- Works for regular variables, uninitialized vars, arrays
- Arrays have a base address that points to the first element
- Char pointers print ASCII character by default, need to cast to print address

# Pointers
---
In [[1. Introduction to programming#C++|C++]], a pointer is a variable that holds the address of another variable.

To declare a pointer:
```cpp
dataType *pointerName;
```

- dataType is the type of data the pointer points to
- The * indicates it is a pointer variable

```cpp
int x = 10, y = 20;

// Declare a Pointers 
int * xPtr = &x; // A pointer to an integer value 
int * yptr; // Declare 
yptr = &x; // Assign
```

## Dereference Operator `*`
---
An interesting property of pointers is that they can be used to access the variable they point directly. This is done by preceding the pointer name with the dereference operator (`*`). The operation itself can be read as value pointed to by"

```cpp
int x = 10; y = 20;

// Declaring a Pointer 
int * xPtr = &x; // a pointer to an integer value 

cout << xPtr; // Address of X
cout << *xPtr; // Value of X (Dereference Operator)
```

**Example:**
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	int x = 10;
	int * xPtr = &x;
	
	cout << x << endl; // 10
	cout << xPtr << endl // address 
	cout << &xPtr << endl; // address of pointer bucket 
	cout << *xPtr << endl; // x -> 10
	cout << *(&x) << endl; // 10
	
	return 0;
}
```

## Null Pointer
---
A null pointer points to address 0 (nothing):
```cpp
int x = 10, y = 20;

// Declaring a Pointer 
int * xPtr = &x; // a pointer to an integer value 

// Setting to NULL
xPtr = 0;
int *p = 0;
int *q = NULL;
```
- Always check for null before dereferencing
- Dereferencing null pointer causes errors

## Double Pointers
---
C++ allows pointers that point to other pointers, called double pointers:
```cpp
int **varPtr; // Holds address of another pointer
```

The rules of dereferencing apply, but an additional `*` is required:

```cpp
cout << **varPtr;
```

# Reference Variables
---
- References are like constant pointers that are automatically dereferenced
- A reference variable us an alias, that is another name for an already existing value (Not to a new memory)
- Declared using `&` instead of `*`

```cpp
int x = 10;
int &xRef = x; // Reference to x
```

- Once initialized, a reference cannot be changed to reference another variable
- More efficient and easier syntax than pointers in many cases

**Example**
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	int x = 10;
	int &y = x;
	
	cout << x << endl; // 10
	cout << y << endl; // 10
	
	return 0;
}
```

# Passing data to functions 
---
There are two main ways to pass data to functions in C++ - by value and by reference:
## 1. Pass by Value
---
Function gets a copy of the arguments, does not modify original
```cpp
void func(int x) {
  x++; // local copy only
}

int n = 10;
func(n); // n unchanged
```

- Changes to parameters not reflected outside
- Okay for basic data types
## 2. Pass by Reference 
---
Function gets a copy of the arguments, does not modify original

- using pointers 

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

void incMoney(int *moneyPtr){
	cout << moneyPtr << endl;
	// De-reference Operator 
	(*moneyPtr) = 2*(*moneyPtr);
}

int main(){
	int money = 10;
	// Pass by reference using pointer variables 
	incMoney(&money);
	cout << "Main : " << money << endl;
	
	return 0;
}
```

- using reference variables 

> [!NOTE]
> - More efficient than copying large data
> - Allows modifying passed parameters
> - Use const to prevent modification

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

// Pass by reference using Reference Variables 
void incMoney(int &myMoney){
	myMoney = 2*myMoney;
	cout << "My Money : " << myMoney << endl;
	
}

int main(){
	int money = 10;
	incMoney(money);
	
	cout << "Main money : " << money << endl;
	
	return 0;
}
```
