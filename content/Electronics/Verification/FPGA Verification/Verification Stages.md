The key verification stages discussed are:

- Planning - For both RTL verification and lab testing
- Verification component development - Reusable stimulus generators and checkers
- Testbench development - Creating test environments
- Basic feature verification - Prior to detailed lab testing
- Advancing testbenches - Adding randomness and coverage
- Regression development - Testing groups of features
