- **Lottery Scheduling:** Uses lottery tickets to represent shares.
- **Stride Scheduling:** A deterministic version of lottery scheduling.
- **Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS):** Uses virtual runtime (`vruntime`) to achieve fairness.

### Lottery Scheduling

- **Tickets:** Represent the share of CPU time a process should receive. The percentage of tickets a process has represents its share of the CPU.
- **Lottery:** Held periodically to determine which process runs next. The scheduler picks a random ticket number, and the process holding that ticket gets to run.
- **Probabilistic Correctness:** Over time, the number of times a process wins the lottery should be proportional to its number of tickets.
- **Ticket Currency:** Allows users to allocate tickets to their jobs in their own currency, which is then converted to a global currency for the lottery.
- **Ticket Transfer:** Processes can temporarily hand off their tickets to other processes.
- **Ticket Inflation:** Processes can temporarily increase or decrease their number of tickets.

### Stride Scheduling

- **Deterministic:** Unlike lottery scheduling, stride scheduling is deterministic. It ensures each job gets its exact share of the CPU over a fixed interval.
- **Stride:** Each job has a stride value, which is inversely proportional to its number of tickets.
- **Pass Value:** A counter for each job that tracks its progress.
- **Scheduling Decision:** The job with the lowest pass value is chosen to run next. After running, its pass value is incremented by its stride.

### Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)

- **Virtual Runtime (vruntime):** A counter that tracks how much CPU time a process has received, adjusted by its priority (niceness).
- **Scheduling Decision:** The process with the lowest vruntime is chosen to run next.
- **sched_latency:** The target latency over which CFS tries to achieve fairness.
- **min_granularity:** The minimum time slice for a process.
- **Niceness and Weight:** Processes can be assigned different priorities (niceness), which are mapped to weights. Weights are used to adjust vruntime and time slice calculations.
- **Red-Black Trees:** CFS uses red-black trees to efficiently manage runnable processes and find the next process to run.

### Challenges of Proportional Share Scheduling

- **I/O Bound Jobs:** Proportional share schedulers may not handle I/O-bound jobs well, as they may not get their fair share of the CPU if they block frequently.
- **Ticket/Priority Assignment:** Determining the appropriate number of tickets or priority for each job can be difficult.

### Use Cases for Proportional Share Scheduling

- **Virtualized Environments:** Allocating CPU resources to virtual machines.
- **Shared Clusters:** Ensuring fair resource allocation among users.

- **Common Errors:** Forgetting to allocate/free memory, not allocating enough memory (buffer overflow), forgetting to initialize allocated memory, freeing memory multiple times (double free), freeing memory before you are done with it (dangling pointer), calling `free()` incorrectly.

### Memory Allocation in C

- **`malloc(size_t size)`:** Allocates a block of memory of the specified size on the heap. Returns a `void` pointer to the allocated memory or `NULL` on failure.
- **`free(void *ptr)`:** Deallocates the memory block pointed to by `ptr`.
- **`calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size)`:** Allocates memory for an array of `nmemb` elements, each of size `size`, and initializes all bytes to zero.

## Chapter 15: Mechanism: Address Translation

### Key Concepts

- **Address Translation:** The hardware mechanism that translates virtual addresses (generated by the process) into physical addresses (used to access memory).
- **Base and Bounds:** A simple form of address translation using two registers:
    - **Base Register:** Stores the starting physical address of a process's address space.
    - **Bounds Register:** Stores the size of the address space.
- **Dynamic Relocation:** The ability to move a process's address space to a different location in physical memory after it has started running.
- **Hardware Support:** Privileged mode, base and bounds registers, address translation circuitry, exception handling.
- **Operating System (OS) Responsibilities:** Memory management, base and bounds management, exception handling.

### Address Translation Process

1. **CPU generates a virtual address (VA).**
2. **Hardware adds the base register value to the VA to get the physical address (PA).**
3. **Hardware checks if the VA is within bounds.**
4. **If the VA is out of bounds, a segmentation fault occurs.**
5. **If the VA is valid, the hardware accesses memory using the PA.**

### Hardware Support

- **Segment Table:** Stores the base address, size, and protection bits for each segment.
- **External Fragmentation:** Wasted space between segments in physical memory.
- **Internal Fragmentation:** Wasted space within a segment.
- **Sharing:** Segments can be shared between processes.
- **Protection:** Segments can have different access permissions (read, write, execute).

### Segmentation vs. Base and Bounds

- Segmentation is a generalization of base and bounds.
- Instead of one base and bounds pair for the entire address space, there is a pair for each segment.
- This allows for more flexible placement of segments in physical memory.

### Segmentation Hardware

- **Segment Table:** Stores base, bounds, and protection bits for each segment.
- **Segment Registers:** Point to the segment table entries for the currently active segments.

### Segmentation and Sharing

- **Code Sharing:** The code segment can be shared between processes by marking it as read-only.
- **Data Sharing:** Other segments can also be shared, but care must be taken to ensure proper synchronization.

### External Fragmentation

- Since segments are variable-sized, external fragmentation can occur.
- Solutions:
    - **Compaction:** Rearrange segments to create larger contiguous free spaces.
    - **Free-List Management Algorithms:** Best fit, worst fit, first fit, next fit.

## Chapter 17: Free-Space Management

### Key Concepts

- **Coalescing:** Merging adjacent free chunks into a larger chunk.
- **External Fragmentation:** Wasted space between allocated blocks.
- **Internal Fragmentation:** Wasted space within an allocated block.

### Free List Implementation

- The free list is typically implemented as a linked list of nodes.
- Each node stores the size and a pointer to the next free block.
- The list can be sorted by address or size.

### Allocation Strategies

- **Best Fit:** Choose the smallest free block that is large enough to satisfy the request.
- **Worst Fit:** Choose the largest free block.
- **First Fit:** Choose the first free block that is large enough.
- **Next Fit:** Similar to first fit, but starts the search from the last allocated block.

- **Handled by the OS:**
    1. Find a free frame or evict a page.
    2. Read the page from disk into the free frame.
    3. Update the page table.
    4. Restart the faulting instruction.

## Chapter 19: Paging: Faster Translations (TLBs)

### Key Concepts

- **TLB Hit:** The desired translation is found in the TLB.
- **TLB Miss:** The desired translation is not found in the TLB.
- **Hardware-Managed TLB:** Hardware handles TLB misses by walking the page table.
- **Software-Managed TLB:** OS handles TLB misses by updating the TLB.

### TLB Basic Algorithm

2. Extract the virtual page number (VPN) from the virtual address.
4. Check if the TLB holds the translation for this VPN.
6. If TLB hit:
    
    - Check protection bits.
    - If access allowed, form physical address and access memory.
    - If access not allowed, raise a protection fault.
    
8. If TLB miss:
    
    - Hardware-managed: Walk the page table, update TLB, retry instruction.
    - Software-managed: Raise a TLB miss exception, OS handles the miss, retries the instruction.

## Chapter 25: A Dialogue on Concurrency

### Key Points

- **Concurrency:** The ability of an operating system to manage multiple threads of execution within a single process.
- **Threads:** Independent sequences of instructions that can be executed concurrently within a shared address space.
- **Challenges of Concurrency:**
    - **Race Conditions:** When the outcome of a program depends on the unpredictable order in which threads execute.
    - **Synchronization:** Coordinating access to shared resources to prevent race conditions.
    - **Deadlocks:** When two or more threads are blocked, each waiting for a resource held by another.

### The Peach Analogy

The professor uses a peach analogy to explain concurrency:

- **Multiple eaters (threads) want to eat peaches (access shared resources).**
- **If they don't coordinate, they might grab the same peach (race condition).**
- **A solution is to form a line (use synchronization).**

### Why Study Concurrency in OS?

- **OS Support:** The OS provides primitives like locks and condition variables for thread synchronization.
- **The OS as a Concurrent Program:** The OS itself is a multi-threaded program and needs to manage its own internal concurrency.

## Chapter 26: Concurrency: An Introduction

### Key Concepts

- **Thread:** A unit of execution within a process.
- **Thread Control Block (TCB):** Stores the state of a thread (similar to PCB for processes).
- **Parallelism:** Using multiple threads to perform tasks simultaneously on multiple processors.
- **Shared Memory:** Threads within a process share the same address space, allowing easy data sharing.
- **Race Conditions:** When the outcome of a program depends on the unpredictable order in which threads execute.
- **Critical Section:** A section of code that accesses shared data and must be executed atomically.
- **Mutual Exclusion:** Ensuring that only one thread can execute a critical section at a time.
- **Indeterminate Program:** A program with race conditions, leading to unpredictable results.

### Why Use Threads?

- **Parallelism:** Speed up computation on multi-processor systems.
- **Avoid Blocking:** Allow a program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for I/O operations to complete.

### Thread Creation Example

- The chapter provides a code example (`threads.c`) that demonstrates thread creation using `pthread_create()`.
- The example shows how the order of thread execution can be non-deterministic.

### Race Conditions and Shared Data

- The chapter presents a code example (`counter.c`) that demonstrates a race condition when multiple threads try to update a shared counter.
- The problem arises because the increment operation is not atomic.

### The Need for Atomicity

- **Atomic Operations:** Operations that appear to execute as a single, indivisible step.
- **Synchronization Primitives:** Tools provided by the OS (e.g., locks, semaphores) to enforce atomicity.

## Chapter 27: Interlude: Thread API

### Key Concepts

- **POSIX Threads (pthreads):** A standard API for thread management in UNIX-like systems.
- **Thread Creation:** `pthread_create()`.
- **Thread Joining:** `pthread_join()`.
- **Locks (Mutexes):** `pthread_mutex_lock()`, `pthread_mutex_unlock()`.
- **Condition Variables:** `pthread_cond_wait()`, `pthread_cond_signal()`.

### Thread Creation

- `pthread_create(thread, attr, start_routine, arg)`:
    - `thread`: Pointer to a `pthread_t` structure to identify the new thread.
    - `attr`: Thread attributes (usually `NULL` for defaults).
    - `start_routine`: The function the thread starts executing.
    - `arg`: Argument passed to the `start_routine`.

### Thread Joining

- `pthread_join(thread, value_ptr)`:
    - Waits for the specified thread to terminate.
    - `value_ptr`: Pointer to a location where the thread's return value can be stored.

### Locks (Mutexes)

- `pthread_mutex_t`: Data type for a mutex.
- `pthread_mutex_init()`: Initializes a mutex.
- `pthread_mutex_lock()`: Acquires the lock.
- `pthread_mutex_unlock()`: Releases the lock.
- `pthread_mutex_trylock()`: Tries to acquire the lock without blocking.
- `pthread_mutex_timedlock()`: Tries to acquire the lock with a timeout.

### Condition Variables

- `pthread_cond_init()`: Initializes a condition variable.
- `pthread_cond_wait(cond, mutex)`: Waits on the condition variable, atomically releasing the associated mutex.
- `pthread_cond_signal(cond)`: Signals one waiting thread to wake up.

## Chapter 28: Locks

### Key Concepts

- **Locks:** Synchronization primitives used to enforce mutual exclusion.
- **Spinlocks:** A simple lock implementation where a thread waits in a loop (spins) until the lock is available.
- **Test-and-Set:** An atomic instruction used to build spinlocks.
- **Compare-and-Swap:** A more powerful atomic instruction that can be used to build locks and other synchronization primitives.
- **Load-Linked/Store-Conditional:** A pair of instructions used to build locks on some architectures.
- **Fetch-and-Add:** An atomic instruction that increments a value and returns the old value.
- **Ticket Lock:** A fair lock implementation using fetch-and-add.
- **Two-Phase Locks:** A lock that first spins and then blocks if it cannot acquire the lock quickly.

### Building Locks

- **Disabling Interrupts:** An early approach for uniprocessors, but not suitable for multiprocessors.
- **Test-and-Set:** A simple way to build a spinlock.
- **Compare-and-Swap:** A more powerful instruction that can be used to build more complex locks.
- **Load-Linked/Store-Conditional:** Similar to compare-and-swap, but available on different architectures.
- **Fetch-and-Add:** Used to build ticket locks, which are fair.

### Evaluating Locks

- **Correctness:** Does the lock provide mutual exclusion?
- **Fairness:** Does each thread get a fair chance to acquire the lock?
- **Performance:** What are the overheads of acquiring and releasing the lock?

### Spinlocks vs. Blocking Locks

- **Spinlocks:** Keep spinning while waiting for the lock. Good for short critical sections and multiprocessors.
- **Blocking Locks:** Put the thread to sleep while waiting for the lock. Better for long critical sections and uniprocessors.

### Two-Phase Locks

- Combine spinning and blocking for better performance.
- Spin for a short time, then block if the lock is not acquired.

## Chapter 29: Lock-based Concurrent Data Structures

### Key Concepts

- **Thread Safety:** Making data structures safe for concurrent access by multiple threads.
- **Common Data Structures:** Counters, linked lists, queues, hash tables.
- **Locking Strategies:** Coarse-grained (one lock for the entire structure) vs. fine-grained (locks for individual parts).
- **Scalability:** How well the data structure performs as the number of threads increases.

### Concurrent Counters

- **Simple Counter:** A single lock protects the counter variable.
- **Approximate Counter:** Uses multiple local counters and a global counter to improve scalability.

### Concurrent Linked Lists

- **Simple Linked List:** A single lock protects the entire list.
- **Hand-over-Hand Locking:** A lock per node, but often not faster than a single lock.

### Concurrent Queues

- **Michael and Scott Queue:** Uses two locks (head and tail) to allow concurrent enqueue and dequeue operations.

### Concurrent Hash Tables

- **Simple Hash Table:** A lock per bucket allows for high concurrency.

### Key Lessons

- **Be careful with lock acquisition and release around control flow changes.**
- **More concurrency doesn't always mean better performance.**
- **Avoid premature optimization.**

## Chapter 30: Condition Variables

### Key Concepts

- **Condition Variables:** Synchronization primitives used for signaling between threads.
- **Wait:** A thread waits on a condition variable until it is signaled.
- **Signal:** A thread signals a condition variable to wake up one or more waiting threads.
- **Producer/Consumer Problem:** A classic concurrency problem where producers generate data and consumers consume it.
- **Bounded Buffer:** A fixed-size buffer used in the producer/consumer problem.
- **Covering Conditions:** A condition that covers all cases where a thread needs to wake up.

### Condition Variable Operations

- `pthread_cond_wait(cond, mutex)`:
    
    - Atomically releases the mutex and puts the calling thread to sleep.
    - When woken up, re-acquires the mutex before returning.
    
- `pthread_cond_signal(cond)`: Wakes up one waiting thread.
- `pthread_cond_broadcast(cond)`: Wakes up all waiting threads.

### Producer/Consumer Problem

- **Problem:** Producers generate data items and put them in a buffer. Consumers take items from the buffer and consume them.
- **Solution:** Use a mutex to protect the buffer and condition variables to signal when the buffer is full or empty.
- **Code Example:** The chapter provides a detailed code example (`producer_consumer.c`) demonstrating the correct use of condition variables to solve the producer/consumer problem.

### Covering Conditions

- **Problem:** When a thread signals a condition variable, it may not know which specific thread(s) to wake up.
- **Solution:** Use `pthread_cond_broadcast()` to wake up all waiting threads.
- **Example:** Memory allocator where multiple threads may be waiting for memory to become available.

### Important Considerations

- **Always use a while loop to check the condition after waking up from `pthread_cond_wait()`.** This is necessary because of Mesa semantics and the possibility of spurious wakeups.
- **Hold the lock associated with the condition variable while signaling.** This prevents race conditions.

## Chapter 31: Semaphores

### Key Concepts

- **Semaphores:** A synchronization primitive that can be used as both a lock and a condition variable.
- **Counting Semaphore:** A semaphore that can have a value greater than one, allowing multiple threads to access a resource concurrently.
- **Binary Semaphore:** A semaphore with a maximum value of one, used for mutual exclusion (like a lock).
- **sem_wait() (P()):** Decrements the semaphore value. If the value becomes negative, the calling thread blocks.
- **sem_post() (V()):** Increments the semaphore value. If there are waiting threads, one is woken up.

### Semaphore Use Cases

- **Mutual Exclusion (Locks):** Binary semaphores can be used to implement locks, ensuring only one thread can access a critical section at a time.
- **Ordering:** Semaphores can be used to enforce ordering constraints between threads, ensuring that one thread waits for another to complete a task before proceeding.
- **Bounded Buffers (Producer/Consumer):** Semaphores can be used to synchronize access to a bounded buffer, where producers add items and consumers remove them.
- **Reader-Writer Locks:** Semaphores can be used to implement reader-writer locks, allowing multiple readers or a single writer to access a shared resource.

### Implementing Semaphores

- Semaphores can be implemented using locks and condition variables.
- The semaphore value is stored in a variable.
- A lock protects access to the value.
- A condition variable is used to block and wake up threads.

### Dining Philosophers Problem

- A classic concurrency problem where philosophers compete for forks to eat.
- Illustrates the challenges of deadlock and starvation.
- Can be solved using semaphores to control access to the forks.

### Thread Throttling

- Semaphores can be used to limit the number of threads concurrently executing a specific section of code.
- This is useful for controlling resource usage and preventing overload.

    - Solution: Use locks to protect critical sections.
    
- **Order Violations:**
    
    - Example: One thread depends on the initialization performed by another thread, but the order is not guaranteed.
    - Solution: Use condition variables or semaphores to enforce ordering.
    

### Deadlock

- **Deadlock Conditions:** All four conditions must hold for deadlock to occur.

- **Deadlock Avoidance:**
    
    - **Banker's Algorithm:** A classic algorithm for deadlock avoidance, but not widely used in practice.
    
- **Deadlock Detection and Recovery:**
    
    - Used in some database systems.
    - Periodically check for cycles in the resource allocation graph.
    - If deadlock is detected, take action to recover (e.g., abort a transaction).

- **Metadata Journaling (Ordered Journaling):** Journals only metadata, data is written directly to its final location.
- **Unordered Journaling:** Data can be written before or after metadata is journaled.

### Journaling Steps

1. **Journal Write:** Write transaction data to the log.
2. **Journal Commit:** Write a transaction commit block to the log.
3. **Checkpoint:** Write data and metadata to their final locations.
4. **Free:** Mark the transaction as free in the journal.

### Challenges and Solutions

### Key Concepts

- **Data Integrity:** Ensuring that data is not corrupted or lost.
- **Checksum:** A small value computed over a block of data to detect errors.
- **Latent Sector Errors (LSEs):** Undetected errors in a disk sector.
- **Block Corruption:** Silent errors where a block contains incorrect data.
- **Misdirected Writes:** Writes to the wrong location on disk.
- **Lost Writes:** Writes that are reported as successful but never actually persisted.
- **Disk Scrubbing:** Periodically reading and verifying data to detect and repair errors.

### Checksumming

- **Checksum Functions:** XOR, addition, Fletcher, CRC.
- **Checksum Placement:** Stored with each block or in separate checksum blocks.
- **Checksum Usage:**
    1. Read data and checksum.
    2. Compute checksum over the data.
    3. Compare computed and stored checksums.
    4. If they match, data is likely valid.
    5. If they don't match, data is corrupted.

### Handling Errors

- **Latent Sector Errors (LSEs):**
    - Easily detected by the disk controller.
    - Recovery: Use redundancy (e.g., RAID) to retrieve correct data.
- **Block Corruption:**
    - Silent errors, harder to detect.
    - Checksums are used to detect corruption.
- **Misdirected Writes:**
    - Writes to the wrong location.
    - Solution: Include physical disk and block identifiers in checksums.
- **Lost Writes:**
    - Writes that are reported as successful but not persisted.
    - Solutions: Write verification, additional checksums in metadata (e.g., ZFS).

### Disk Scrubbing

- Periodically reading and verifying data to detect and repair errors.
- Helps prevent data loss due to undetected corruption.

### Checksum Overheads

- **Space Overhead:**
    - Disk: Checksums consume storage space.
    - Memory: Checksums need to be stored temporarily in memory.
- **Time Overhead:**
    - CPU cycles for checksum computation.
    - Potential extra I/O for reading and writing checksums.

## Chapter 46: Summary Dialogue on Persistence

### Communication Basics

- **Messages:** The basic unit of communication.
- **Unreliable Communication:** Messages can be lost or corrupted.
- **Reliable Communication:** Ensures messages are delivered reliably using acknowledgments and retransmissions.

### Unreliable Communication: UDP

- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** A connectionless, unreliable protocol.
- **Datagrams:** Fixed-size messages sent over UDP.
- **No guarantee of delivery or order.**

### Reliable Communication: TCP

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** A connection-oriented, reliable protocol.
- **Acknowledgments:** Used to confirm receipt of messages.
- **Timeouts and Retries:** Used to handle lost messages.
- **Sequence Numbers:** Ensure in-order delivery and duplicate detection.

### Communication Abstractions

- **Distributed Shared Memory (DSM):** Allows processes on different machines to share memory, but not widely used due to challenges with failure and performance.
- **Remote Procedure Call (RPC):** Makes remote function calls look like local function calls.

### Remote Procedure Call (RPC)

- **Goal:** Simplify distributed programming by abstracting communication details.
- **Components:**
    - **Stub Generator:** Generates client and server stubs.
    - **Runtime Library:** Handles communication, serialization, and other details.
- **Challenges:**
    - **Naming:** Locating remote services.
    - **Transport Protocol:** Choosing between TCP and UDP.
    - **Complex Arguments:** Marshaling and unmarshaling complex data structures.
    - **Server Organization:** Thread pools for concurrency.
    - **Byte Ordering:** Handling differences in endianness.
    - **Asynchronous RPC:** Allowing non-blocking calls.

## Chapter 49: Sun's Network File System (NFS)

### Key Concepts

- **NFS (Network File System):** A distributed file system that allows clients to access files stored on a remote server.
- **Stateless Protocol:** The NFS server does not maintain any client state, simplifying crash recovery.
- **Idempotent Operations:** NFS operations can be repeated without adverse effects, enabling easy recovery from failures.
- **File Handles:** Unique identifiers for files and directories.
- **Client-Side Caching:** Caching file data on the client to improve performance.
- **Cache Consistency:** Ensuring that clients see the most up-to-date version of files.
- **Flush-on-Close:** A cache consistency mechanism where updates are sent to the server when a file is closed.
- **Attribute Cache:** Caches file attributes (metadata) on the client to reduce server load.

### NFS Protocol

- **LOOKUP:** Obtains a file handle for a file or directory.
- **GETATTR:** Retrieves file attributes (metadata).
- **READ:** Reads data from a file.
- **WRITE:** Writes data to a file.
- **CREATE:** Creates a new file.
- **REMOVE:** Removes a file.
- **MKDIR:** Creates a new directory.
- **RMDIR:** Removes a directory.
- **READDIR:** Reads directory entries.

### NFS Implementation

- **Client-Side:**
    - Translates file system calls into NFS protocol messages.
    - Caches file data and metadata.
    - Handles cache consistency.
- **Server-Side:**
    - Processes NFS protocol messages.
    - Reads and writes data to disk.
    - Does not maintain client state.

### NFS Cache Consistency

- **Flush-on-Close:** Ensures updates are visible to other clients when a file is closed.
- **Attribute Cache:** Reduces server load by caching file attributes on the client.

### NFS Challenges

- **Cache Consistency:** Can be complex and lead to stale data.
- **Security:** Early versions had weak security.
- **Performance:** Network latency can be a bottleneck.

### AFS Protocol

- **Fetch:** Retrieves a file from the server and caches it on the client.
- **Store:** Sends a modified file back to the server.
- **Callback:** The server promises to notify the client if a cached file is modified.
- **TestAuth:** Checks if a cached file is still valid.

### AFS Implementation

- **Client-Side (Venus):**
    - Caches entire files on local disk.
    - Uses callbacks to maintain cache consistency.
- **Server-Side (Vice):**
    - Stores files and directories.
    - Handles client requests.
