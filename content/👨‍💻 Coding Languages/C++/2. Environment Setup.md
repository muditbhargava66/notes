The C++ development environment consists of:

- A text editor to write C++ code
- A compiler to convert code into an executable
- Tools to run and debug the executable

## Editors

Popular editors for C++ include:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)Â - Free, open-source, extensions available
- Xcode (Mac only)
- CLion - Paid

## Compilers ^compiler

The most common C++ compilers are:
- g++ (Linux & Mac)
- MinGW (Windows)
- Visual C++ (Windows)

Compilers convert C++ source code into machine code the computer can run.

To compile with g++ on command line:

```
g++ myProgram.cpp -o myProgram
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `-o` flag names the output executable file.

## Local IDE

An integrated development environment (IDE) is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI).

IDE is a software that allows you to **create, edit, run, test & debug** your code from a single GUI.

To run a C++ on our machine, we need
- Text editor 
- C++ [[#Compilers compiler|compiler]]
- Command line/ Terminal to invoke the computer 

## Absolute vs Relative Paths

Absolute path specifies the full location of a file or folder from the root of the file system. For example:

```
/User/name/Documents/program.cpp
```

A relative path specifies the location relative to the current working directory. For example, if you are already in the Documents folder:

```
program.cpp
```

Using the correct path is important when accessing files from terminals or code.
