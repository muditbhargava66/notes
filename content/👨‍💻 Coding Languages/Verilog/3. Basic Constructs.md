## Internal Signals

Verilog modules use **internal signals** to connect between sub-modules and build the overall functionality. These signals can be nets or variables assigned using continuous assignments (`assign`) or procedural assignments (`always` blocks).

## Precedence

Notice that we fully **parenthesized** the `cout` computation, We could take advantage of operator  precedence to use fewer parentheses:
```verilog
assign cout = a&b | cin&(a|b);
```
The precedence from highest to lowest is:

| Symbol | Meaning | Precedence |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| - | NOT  | Highest |
| *, /, % | MUL, DIV, MODULO  |  |
| +, - | PLUS, MINUS |  |
| <<, >>, | Logical Left/Logical Right |  |
| <<<, >>> | Arithmetic Left/Right Shift |  |
| <, <=, >, >= | Relative Comparsion |  |
| ==, != | Equality Comparision |  |
| &, ~& | AND, NAND |  |
| ^, ~^ | XOR, XNOR |  |
| \|, ~\| | OR, NOR |  |
| ?: | Conditional | Lowest |
> [!NOTE]
> The precedence order is as expected - AND before OR. 
> Follows conventional programming languages.

## Constants 

Verilog supports decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal constants:

| Number | No. of <br>Bits | Base | Decimal <br>Equivalent | Stored |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 3'b101 | 3 | Binary  | 5 | 101 |
| 'b11 | unsized  | Binary  | 3 | 00000000..00011 |
| 8'b11 | 8 | Binary  | 3 | 00000000..00011  |
| 8'b1010_1011 | 8 | Binary  | 171 | 10101011 |
| 3'd6 | 3 | Decimal  | 6 | 110 |
| 6'o42 | 6 | Octal  | 34 | 100010 |
| 8'hAB | 8 | Hexadecimal  | 171 | 10101011  |
| 42 | unsized  | Decimal  | 42 | 0000...00101010 |

> [!NOTE]
> It is good practice to specify the length of the number in bits, even though the second row shows that this is not strictly necessary. If you don't specify the length, one day you may be surprised when verilog assumes the constant has additional leading 0's that you didn't intend. 
> 
> *Underscores* in numbers are ignored and can be helpful in breaking long numbers into more readable chunks. 
> 
> If the based is omitted, the number is assumed to be decimal.
