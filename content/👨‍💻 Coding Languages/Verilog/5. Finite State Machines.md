 ## Finite State Machines
There are two styles of finite state machine.
- Moore vs Mealy
    - [[5.1. Moore|Moore]]: Output is a function of only the current state.

    - [[5.2. Mealy|Mealy]]: Output is a function of the current state and inputs.

FSMs are modeled in Verilog with an `always` block defining the state registers and combinational logic defining the next state and output logic.

- FSM Verilog Template:
```verilog
reg [state vars]  
parameter [state encodings]

always @(posedge clk) 
	case (state)
		[transitions] 
	endcase
	
assign output = f(state); 
```
## FSM Example: 

### Divide-by-3 Counter

Let's look at a simple finite state machine (FSM) example with one output and no inputs - a divide-by-3 counter. The output should be asserted (set to 1) every three clock cycles.

The state transition diagram for this Moore FSM is:
![[Pasted image 20240209020056.png|Divide-by-3 counter state transition diagram]]
The output value is labeled in each state because in a Moore machine, the output depends only on the current state.

There are three states:

- S0
- S1
- S2

On each clock edge:

- S0 transitions to S1
- S1 transitions to S2
- S2 transitions to S0

Here is the Verilog code to implement this FSM:

```verilog
module divideby3FSM( 
	input clk, 
	input reset, 
	output out);
	
	// State Encoding 
	reg [1:0] state, nextstate;
	
	parameter S0 = 2'b00;
	parameter S1 = 2'b01;
	parameter S2 = 2'b10;

	// State Registers 
	always @(posedge clk, posedge reset)
		if (reset) state <= S0;
		else       state <= nextstate;

	// Next State Logic
	always @(*)
		case (state)
			S0: nextstate <= S1;
			S1: nextstate <= S2;
			S2: nextstate <= S0;
			default: nextstate <= S0;
		endcase
	
	// Output Logic 
	assign out = (state == S2);
endmodule
```
The key components of the FSM are:

- `state` register - holds the current state
- `nextstate` logic - computes next state
- `output` logic - generates outputs based on current state

By breaking the FSM into these three sections, we can clearly see the state transitions, outputs, and combinational/sequential logic.

### Clock Divider

Let's look at an example of a clock divider module in Verilog. This module takes in a clock signal `CLK` and generates an output clock `CLK_DIV3` that is a third of the input frequency.

The module interface is:
```verilog
input CLK        // Input clock 
input RESET      // Active-high reset  
input CE         // Clock enable 
output CLK_DIV3  // Divided clock outputs 
```
The implementation uses a 2-bit counter `count` to divide the frequency by 3.
```verilog
module clk_div3 (
  input CLK,
  input RESET, 
  input CE,
  output CLK_DIV3
);

reg [1:0] count; // Counter to divide clock by 3
reg CLK_DIV3;

always @(posedge CLK or posedge RESET) begin

  if(RESET) begin  // Asynchronous reset
    count <= 0;
    CLK_DIV3 <= 0;
  end
  
  else begin
    if(CE) begin  // Increment counter if CE is high
      count <= count + 1;
      
      if(count == 2) begin // When count reaches 2
        count <= 0;  // Reset counter
        CLK_DIV3 <= ~CLK_DIV3;  // Toggle output to divide clock
      end
    end
  end
end

endmodule
```

On each clock edge, the `count` value increments if `CE` is high. When `count` reaches 2, it resets to 0 and `CLK_DIV3` is toggled to create a divided clock output.
The key advantage of this approach is that the divided clock rate can be easily configured by changing the counter size and toggle value.
We use an asynchronous reset rather than a synchronous reset for the following reasons:

> [!NOTE]
> 1. It initializes the circuit immediately, regardless of clock edge:
> - An async reset allows the state to initialize as soon as `RESET` is asserted high. This resets the circuit right away.
> - With a sync reset, we would have to wait for a clock edge for the reset to take effect after asserting the signal.
> 
> 2. It handles issues with the clock:
> - If the clock signal is unstable during power up, an async reset will still reset the state reliably.
> - A sync reset would not work correctly if the clock is not toggling when reset is first applied.
> 
> 3. It resets sequencing logic cleanly:
> - Any counters or state machines initialize to their first state. With a sync reset, intermediate states could be seen before resetting to initial state.
