- - C language history:
    - Developed by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson
    - Designed for OS and systems development (UNIX)
    - Provides excellent control over hardware resources
    - Established many programming paradigms still used today

- Low-level languages expose hardware details vs high-level languages which hide them
- Benefits:
    - Performance - optimize code for hardware
    - Control - directly manage hardware resources
- Downsides:
    - Portability - hardware-dependent code doesn't transfer well
    - Productivity - more verbose, focus on hardware not problem
- C is excellent for OS and compiler development by providing good control over hardware
