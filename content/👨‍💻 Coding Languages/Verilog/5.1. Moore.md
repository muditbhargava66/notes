In a Moore FSM, the output depends **only on the current state**:

- The output logic is purely a function of the current state.
- Transitions between states take place on clock edges based on inputs.
- But output is associated only with the state itself.

**Advantages:**

- Output is synchronized with the clock 

**Disadvantages:** 

- State explosion if designing complex systems

**Example Moore FSM module template:**

```verilog 
reg [state reg]
parameter [state encodings]

always @(posedge clk)  
    case (state)
       // state transitions
    endcase

assign output = f(state);
```

So in summary, Moore FSM outputs are a function of just the present state, leading to synchronized transitions but potentially more states.
