# Loops 
---
When you need to repeat a block of code multiple times, use loops in C++. Loops allow you to automate repetitive tasks efficiently.

Main types of loops in C++:
- [[#Loops|Loops]] 
- [[#While Loop|While Loop]]
- [[#For Loop|For Loop]] 
- [[#Do While Loop|Do While Loop]]
- [[#Nested Loops|Nested Loops]]

## While Loop
---
The `while loop` loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

```cpp
// initialization

while(condition){
	// code block 
	// update
}
```

- Initializes a variable before the loop
- Checks condition each iteration
- Updates variable inside loop body

```cpp
// Example 

int i = 0;
while(i<5){
	cout << i << "\n";
	i++;
}

/* Output:
0
1
2
3
4
*/
```

> `\n` is used for adding new lines while displaying the output.

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	// Read N Numbers and find their sum
	int n;
	cin >> n;
	
	int i = 1; // Track the number of times loop is going to run 
	int sum = 0;
	while(i<=n){
		// cout << i << endl;
		int num;
		cint >> num;
		sum = sum + num;
		i = i+1;
	}
	
	// Final sum
	cout << sum << endl;
}
```

## For Loop 
---
The `For loop` is very similar to while loop, it combines the 3 steps that have seen in a single line. Both [[#For Loop|for loop]] and [[#While Loop]] can be be used interchangeably and have some performance.

```cpp
for(inttialization; condition; update){
	// code block 
}
```

- Often used when number of iterations is known
- Easier to read than while loops

```cpp
for(int step=1; step<=5; step=step+1){
	
	// code block 
	cout << step << endl;
}
```

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	
	// Scope of i is restricted and it became local to the loop
	// But if we declared it outside as well
	int i;
	
	// For loop 1
	for(int i=0; i<=5; i=i+1){
		cout << i << endl;
	}

	// For loop 2
	for(; \i<=5; ){
		cout << i << endl;
		i=i+1;
	}

	cout << "After the loop:" << i << endl;
}
```

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	
	// Read N Numbers and find the sum of numbers which are even
	int n;
	cin >> nn:
	
	int sum = 0;
	
	// For Loop
	for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){ 
		int num;
		cin >> num;
		
		// Conditional Statement 
		if(num%2==0){ 
			sum = sum + num;
			}
	}
	
	cout << "Sum of even numbers:" << sum << endl;
}
```

> Both `while` and `for` loops are **Entry Controlled** Loops.

## Do While Loop 
---
The `do while` loop is a **exit controlled loop**.
This loop will execute the **code block at-least once**, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as the condition is true

```cpp
do {
   // code block 
} while(condition);
```

```cpp
int i=0;
do {
	cout << i << "\n"
	i++;
}
while (i < 5)
```

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	// Do while loops 
	int money =5;
	
	do{
		cout << "Shopping with money: " << money << endl;
		money = money - 1;
	}
	while(money>0);

	return 0;
}

/* Output:
Shopping with money: 5
Shopping with money: 4
Shopping with money: 3
Shopping with money: 2
Shopping with money: 1
*/
```

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	
	// Read numers until I don't get negatove number 
	// 10, 2, 54, 22, -9 Stops 
	
	int number;
	do{
		cin >> number;
		cout << number;
	}
	while(number>=0);
}
```

## Nested Loops 
---
You can place a loop inside another loop to create `nested loops`. Useful for iterating through multidimensional data.

```cpp
for(int i=0; i<3; i++) {
  
  for(int j=0; j<5; j++) {
    // inner loop 
  } 

}
```

## Break Statement 
---
`Break Statement` is used to **explicitly terminate** the loop based upon a certain condition.
As soon as the `break statement` is encountered from within a loop, the loop stops and control returns from the loop immediately to the first statement after the loop.

```cpp
while(condition1){

		if(condition2){
			break;
	}
}
```

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){

	int cal = 0;
	int mom_calls_up = 10;
	
	while(cal<50){
		cout << "Running and Burning " << cal << endl;
		if(cal == mom_calls_up){
			break;
		}
		cal = cal + 1;
	}
	cout << "Workout complete " << cal << endl;
	
	return 0;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `break` statement allows you to terminate the nearest enclosing loop statement immediately.

### Break example - Prime checker:
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	int N;
	cin >> N;
	// Check if the hiven N is prime or not
	
	int i;
	for(i = 2; i < N; i++){
		// if N is divisible by i
		if(N%i==0){
			break; // N is divisible - not prime
		}
	}
	
	if(i==N){
		// Loop ended normally
		cout << "Prime" << endl;
	}
	else{
		cout << "Not Prime" << endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
```
Here `break` exits the loop early if a factor is found. After the loop, we can check if it iterated all the way to N to determine if N is prime.

## Continue Statement 
---
It is also a **control statement**, The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of a loop but does **not** terminate the loop. Execution jumps to the next iteration.
```cpp

while(....){
		if(condition){
				continue;
		}
	
	// Rest of loop body
}
```

When `continue` is executed, the remaining statements in the loop body are skipped and the next loop iteration begins.

Continue example - Skipping multiples of 7:
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	
	int i = 0;
	while(i<=20){
	
		if(i%7==0){
			cout << "Mutiple of 7" << endl;
			i = i+1;
			continue;
		}
		
		cout << i << endl;
		i++
	}
	return 0;
}
```

Here when `i` is a multiple of 7 we print a message and use `continue` to skip printing `i`.

> [!NOTE]
> The key difference from `break` is that `continue` moves to the next _iteration_ rather than terminating the whole loop.
