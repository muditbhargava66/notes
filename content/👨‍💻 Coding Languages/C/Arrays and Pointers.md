- Arrays consist of contiguous memory allocated for elements
- Pointers contain memory addresses as unsigned integers
- Pointer arithmetic factors in size of data type
- Array access is converted by compiler to pointer arithmetic
- Matrices can be represented as array of arrays
- Data structures like linked lists use pointers between elements
- Dynamic memory allocation returns a pointer to allocated memory
- Can simulate pass-by-reference with pointers as function arguments
