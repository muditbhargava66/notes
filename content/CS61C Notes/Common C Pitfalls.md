Some aspects of C that often trip up programmers:

- Complex operator precedence rules - use parentheses liberally
- Type casting can lead to unexpected behavior
- `switch` statements "fall through" cases - add `break` statements
- `static` means different things in local vs global scope

- Common bugs:
    - Forgetting break statements in switch blocks
    - Mismatched pointer types in casts
    - Misunderstanding order of increment/decrement operators
    - Undefined behavior from numerical overflow or invalid memory access
