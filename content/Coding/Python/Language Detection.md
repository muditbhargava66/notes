### Language Detection in Python using langdetect 

This Python script demonstrates how to detect the language of a given text using the `langdetect` library.

```python
from langdetect import detect 

# Input text in any language 
text = input("Enter any text in any language: ") 

# Detect and print the language 
print(detect(text))
```

Make sure you have the `langdetect` library installed before running the code.
